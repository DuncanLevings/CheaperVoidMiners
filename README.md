# CheaperVoidMiners (GTNH 2.8.4)

Fork of: https://github.com/Tungsten-W-74/CheaperVoidMiners  
Rebalanced and updated for **GregTech: New Horizons 2.8.4**

---

## Overview

Adds three early-tier Void Miner variants using the standard ZPM Void Miner structure, but built with tier-appropriate materials.
IE. GTNH Void Miner - https://gtnh.miraheze.org/wiki/Void_Miner

Purpose is to provide constant ore production similar to GTNH ZPM+ Void Miners in earlier tiers allowing more focus on infastructure and factory building rather than vein searching and mining.

- **Void Miner EX I (LV)** — 2 ores/sec  
- **Void Miner EX II (HV)** — 4 ores/sec  
- **Void Miner EX III (IV)** — 8 ores/sec  

---

## Balance Adjustments

- Noble gas boosting **disabled**
- Fixed output scaling per tier (2 / 4 / 8)
- Recipes gated near end of respective tier
- Designed for early to mid game infrastructure progression

---

## Compatibility

- **GTNH 2.8.4**
- Minecraft **1.7.10**
